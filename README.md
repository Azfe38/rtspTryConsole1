# rtspTryConsole1

This C# console project is developed to capture Real-Time video streams using RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) and apply computer vision techniques. The following C# code captures a video stream from an RTSP URL and displays it live using the Emgu CV library.

The project provides a foundation for processing live video streams using Computer Vision techniques. The obtained data can be used in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence fields such as object recognition and classification.
